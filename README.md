# Path-Planning-in-Robot-Operating-System-ROS2
This project focuses on implementing the Dijkstra algorithm for path planning in the ROS2 environment. The Dijkstra algorithm, known for finding the shortest path, ensures efficient autonomous robot navigation from one point to another while avoiding obstacles in both simulated and real-world environments.
